# Moon's Hacker Card

Its my own hacker pcb card! It has the typical stuff a NFC chip and art made by me and birb.

sadly it was done in speedrun mode lol. I will try to make the readme better in the future!!!

For future info, I've used the hack club's [hack card](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) guide for making this card!
